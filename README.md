## How to use?
Before using the python script, ensure that `pytesseract, pdf2image, opencv and other supporting libraries` are installed.

After installing *pytesseract*, make sure the `pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd` variable points to your *tesseract.exe* location.
 **Next**, make sure *poppler* is installed too and the `poppler_path` points to the **Library/bin** folder.
 
 Run the script using `python main.py`
